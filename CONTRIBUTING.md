## Team Norms

### Team Values

- When it comes to resolving conflicts on decision for the direction of RecipeBox, we'll have a vote amongst the five of us and the majority will take the cake. If someone tends to be super passionate about an idea they can plead their case.

- When a member is failing to complete their obligations, such as not completing their work timely or communicating clearly, contact either Scrum Master or Product Owner if you are not comfortable calling them out on your own during the next standup. Upon a second callout, talk to another member of the group and if you both confer the team member should be brought up to to Amos

- If one of the team members is having issues, with GitHub, Express, etc., then reach out to another team member for help or assistance learning / working on your part.

- When someone feels like they have too much work, bring it up during a standup to redistribute it. If someone is willing to take up the work great, otherwise do so by git commit numbers or something.

- As for our main form of communication, we will continue using the Slack channel. For secondary communication we will use Discord.

- When it comes to working on things, we don't always have to do things on our own. When we do things that require multiple people, like reviewing things in a call or using the same CSS, we can do those things together in a call or communicating via above channels while checking it freqently.

### Sprint Cadence

According to the class schedule, each sprint will last two weeks. This will focus on various aspects of the app that build up over the sprints (e.g. front end might be worked on during sprint 3 if something comes up).

### Daily Standups

Standups will happen three times a week on the following schedule.

Wednesday: 4:45 - 5:15 PM EST
Fridays: 2:00 - 2:30 PM EST
Sundays: 8:00 - 8:30 PM EST

Standups will take place on Zoom on a re-occurring link. They will last approximately 30 minutes as a high end estimate, with the "actual" standup lasting 5 to 15 minutes and the rest of the time spent working on tasks, code review, and sprint planning.

### Coding Standards

The editor we will be using is **VS Code.** _Linter and CI TBD._

## Git Workflow of RecipeBox

RecipeBox uses a simple git workflow of develop branches.

For any user's current progress, they push to a develop branch with their name, e.g. `John-develop`, and create a PR when they are ready to add their changes to the trunk of the project.
