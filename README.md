# RecipeBox

![Build Status](https://github.com/agile-dev-assignments/project-setup-team-ntobo-global/actions/workflows/github-actions.yml/badge.svg)

## Vision Statement

RecipeBox is an application that has set out to create an easy one-stop-shop for any and all recipes you want to look for and store that are based by other users- not large websites or automatic algorithms.

### MVP

The minimum viable product, or MVP, sets out to establish RecipeBox as a social media platform focused on the sharing and saving of favorite recipes. Users will, on a base level that goes into more detail below, be able to search for recipes by keyword or browse users they may have heard of. They can browse groups of recipes sorted by keyword and scroll through user profiles of all recipes.

Upon logging in, which is included in the MVP as it is core to having a recipe box in the first place, the most significant change is that users will be able to add recipes to their RecipeBox- like bookmarks. These primary goals- browsing recipes by title and users as well as saving recipes- serves as the core of RecipeBox and expansion will go off of those features.

### Additional Features

Additional features post-MVP include, but are not limited to:

- Having a curated feed of recipes from users you follow
- Liking and commenting on other users posts
- Sorting your own recipes with "supertags" within the RecipeBox
- Following users

## Themes

The themes of our MVP will be broken down into the outlined things above. More explicitly, this would be in the form of:

- As a user, I will be able to search up recipes by name and users by name or username
- As a signed in user, I will be able to follow other users and bookmark recipes I like

## What Problem Does RecipeBox Solve?

Currently, when searching online for a recipe, it's hard to know which ones are the best, since they are typically spread across different sites with different rating systems. In addition, Google's search algorithms tend to favor sites belonging to food related brands and tv channels, as opposed to blogs and smaller sites with family recipes. There also is no easy, efficient way of saving your favorite recipes or recipes that you want to try out in the future, as they are spread across these various sites.

RecipeBox also incorporates many of the features that are common to social media, such as follows, likes, and comments. Following a user allows you to keep up with your friends and your favorite chefs through your feed. Liking a recipe adds it to your recipe box (so that you can easily find it again in the future) while also doubling as the rating system for the platform.
